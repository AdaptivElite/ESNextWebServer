ES6WebServer
============

The first open source ecma6 web server for nodejs.

Work in progress
================

Note that this is currently under heavy development. The server is stable however lacking in many features.
Live speed testing has shown that when using the server as intended it is one of the fastest web servers.
That being said if you like the idea feel free to watch and ask for features.

Road map
========

1. Create a way to install the server.
2. Finish example setup.
3. Create install and setup instructions.
