ES6WebServer
============

The first open source ecma6 web server for nodejs.

Work in progress
================

Note that this is currently under heavy development. It is not stable to even use at this point.
That being said if you like the idea feel free to watch and ask for features.

Road map
========

1. Create a stable build that does more then hello world followed by a crash or the other way.
